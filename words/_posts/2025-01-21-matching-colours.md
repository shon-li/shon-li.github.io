title      : Is it possible to match any two colours?
---
You just need to set brightness, saturation, contrast, area, shape, etc., right? But in some other times, viewers have their own opinions about \'matching\'.

Once a graphic designer has decided to match two colours, they would do their best effort to test all possible combinations. When they had tested everything they could but still couldn\'t be satisfied, they might consider giving up. There can be very challenging cases in which the two colours seem simply to contradict each other.

Whether the designer decides to give up depends on how much they wanted these two colours to be together. I believe that if you keep trying, it\'s always possible to match any two colours. Although I might need to take a break, I would not stop thinking about new ideas because I believe that a colour is always flexible.

Only if I am told to stop will I stop.
