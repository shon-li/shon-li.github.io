Tools like Jekyll looked mysterious to me in the past. After some irrelevant coding practices during my study, I somehow feel more confident at learning to use them.</p><p>I picked Jekyll because it is the classic – it is widely used everywhere and GitHub Page supports it well. I want to understand how it works, so I can have a good sense about how other similar tools work. Also, I hope I can make my website more interesting for myself and my readers. I really doubt if I have more than two readers. I am very grateful that anyone would read what I have written. Thank you, and I love you all.</p><p>In my initial thought, this website will not look like a blog at all, but I have to make baby steps, so I will do what I can to make small changes.</p></article></main><footer ><table><tr><td><a href="/contents.html">Contents</a><td><a href="/">Home</a><td><a href="/appendix.html">Appendix</a></table><span class="copyright">&copy;&nbsp;6 Dec 2024&nbsp;・&nbsp;Shon Li</span></footer>
