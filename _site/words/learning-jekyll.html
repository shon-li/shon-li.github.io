Tools like Jekyll once looked mysterious to me. After some irrelevant coding practices during my engineering study, I somehow feel more confident about learning to use them.</p><p>I picked Jekyll because it is the classic – it is widely used and GitHub Page supports it well. So it is a perfect entry level tool for me. I want to understand how it works, so I can have a good sense about how other similar tools work. Also, I hope I can make my website more interesting for myself.</p><p>In my initial thoughts, this website will not look like a blog at all, but I have to make baby steps, so I will do what I can to make small changes. It is better to make a kick start rather than stay at thinking. I will make frequent heartened changes to improve.</p><p>This post is intentionally written in English. Not to show-off my competency in this language, but a test on the layout design. After some trials and errors, I decided to take a chaotic approach on multi-language support. I will simply smash two languages together on my website. It is much easier to handle on a static site generator; also, it is how I process the languages in my mind. Words and characters swirl in my mind wiggling meanings and concepts. I know most people probably will not enjoy that, but for the ones who do – yay!</p><p>I found something annoying – the apostrophe, “’”. It is always rendered in full width which is what I hate to see. My HTML file encoding is alright; CSS text align is non-negotiable; I want to use Markdown to simply writing. <del>So I am out of solution for now. I will try to avoid typing that key when I am writing here.</del> Agh… Turns out I only need to use a backslash to escape that character when writing in Markdown. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\'</code> gives '. Hahah… =D</p><p>I will add some of my understandings about Jekyll here later.</p></article></main><footer > CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 &nbsp; &copy; &nbsp;6th December 2024&nbsp;・&nbsp;Shon Li<nav><a href="/">目录 CONTENTS</a><a href="/front-page.html">首页 FRONT-PAGE</a><a href="/readme.html">备注 APPENDIX</a></nav></footer>
