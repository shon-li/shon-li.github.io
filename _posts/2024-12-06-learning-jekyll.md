title: Learning Jekyll
---
I finally decided to use a static site generator. Tools like Jekyll once looked mysterious to me. After some irrelevant coding practices during my engineering study, I somehow feel more confident about learning to use them.

I picked Jekyll because it is the classic – it is widely used and GitHub Page supports it well. So it is a perfect entry level tool for me. I want to understand how it works, so I can have a good sense about how other similar tools work. Also, I hope I can make my website more interesting for myself.

In my initial thoughts, this website will not look like a blog at all, but I have to make baby steps, so I will do what I can to make small changes. It is better to make a kick start rather than stay at thinking. I will make frequent heartened changes to improve.

This post is intentionally written in English. Not to show-off my competency in this language, but a test on the layout design. After some trials and errors, I decided to take a chaotic approach on multi-language support. I will simply smash two languages together on my website. It is much easier to handle on a static site generator; also, it is how I process the languages in my mind. Words and characters swirl in my mind wiggling meanings and concepts. I know most people probably will not enjoy that, but for the ones who do – yay!

I found something annoying – the apostrophe, "'". It is always rendered in full width which is what I hate to see. My HTML file encoding is alright; CSS text align is non-negotiable; I want to use Markdown to simply writing. ~~So I am out of solution for now. I will try to avoid typing that key when I am writing here.~~ Agh... Turns out I only need to use a backslash to escape that character when writing in Markdown. `\'` gives \'. Hahah... =D

I will add some of my understandings about Jekyll here later.
